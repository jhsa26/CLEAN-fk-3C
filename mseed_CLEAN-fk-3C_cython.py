#    by Martin Gal
#    2016 - May - 16
#
# Python modules needed:
# Obspy, numpy,scipy, matplotlib, cython
#
# To compile cython code type:
# python subroutine_cython_setup.py build_ext --inplace
#
#
# functions used:
# ---------------
# read                   ... obspy read function
# get_metadata           ... reads metadata from standard iris output
# equalize               ... checks if there are equal amout of traces and if all stations are in the correct order
# metric_mseed           ... generates coordinates for the stations
# remove_gain            ... removes gain, i.e. conversion to m/s
# PSAR_dict()            ... azimuth for BH1 component of PSAR, returns dictionary with station name and angle
# make_subwindows_PSAR   ... makes subwindows with data, mean removed and Hann taper applied
# make_csdm_cython       ... generates the cross spectral density matrix
# CLEAN_3C_fk_cython     ... CLEAN procedure
# make_P_fk_cython_v3    ... 3 component beamformer
# get_max_cython         ... extracts maxima of strongest source on each component
# make_plot              ... Plots the beamforming results
# refine_max             ... Runs a nested grid to find a more accurate slowness vector which is used for clean iterations
#
#
#
# variables used:
# ---------------
# nsamp          ... amount of data points in a temporal subwindow
# smin           ... minimum slowness that is used to perform the slowness search [s/deg]
# smax           ... max slowness. values -50 and 50 are standard for these smin and smax
# sinc           ... the increment of the slowness. the lower the more accurate the finer the grid-search is. default value should be 0.5
# find           ... frequency at which the DOA is performed. warning: it is not [Hz]. It connected to the frequency by the equation freq = find/(nsamp*dt)
#                    where freq is in [Hz]. 
# fave           ... frequency to average over. Do not use more than 5% of find, otherwise your results can be biased in the velocity estimation.
# control        ... control parameter that extracts power (between 0-1). 0.1 is default 
# cln_iter       ... number of iterations for the CLEAN algo, set at 0, you get the normal 3C beamforming result. Set a higher value to clean spectrum.
#                    for CLEAN, try 30 and go from there depending on what you would like to achieve.
# show_peak_info ... information about peaks from which energy is removed, works for cln_iter > 0, 
#                    energy is removed from 3 components, hence there will be 3 peaks removed per iteration.
# st             ... matrix of Z data. first element is sensor station and second element is time series. dimensions are st[nr][nsamp]
# st0            ... North-South component, can also be BH1
# st1            ... East-West component or BH2
# folder         ... path to metadata directory
# meta_f         ... full path to metadata file
# dic_meta       ... dictionary with station name/location information
# nr             ... amount of array stations/sensors
# rx             ... vector of r_x component for all stations. rx is in [deg]. reference station of the array is always first sensor in the sequence.
# ry             ... vector of r_y component ..
# nwin           ... amount of time windows that need to be extracted from the time series
# dt             ... time steps. dependent on array.
# freq           ... frequency at which the DOA is performed in [Hz]
# df             ... averaging frequency
# kmin           ... minimum wavenumber. it is used later for the calculation as all angles need to be considered of the arriving signal.
#                    the steering vector is basically exp(ikr) where r is the interstation distance in [deg].
# kmax           ... max wavenumber
# kinc           ... wavenumber increment
# nk             ... amount of slowness steps/ respectively wavenumber steps from min to ma
# pdic           ... dictionary with BH1 azimuth directions. (this is made specifically for the philbara array /PSAR)
# xt             ... data split into temporal subwindows, mean removed and Hann taper applied.
# csdm           ... cross spectral density matrix
# fk_cln         ... clean power spectrum 
# polariz        ... power output for Z,R,T component
# max_c          ... xy-slowness of stronges source in polariz [s/deg,s/deg]x3
# max_o          ... power of strongest source in polariz 
# Z,R,T          ... normalized power components [dB]
# Z,R,T          ... normalized power components [dB]
# src_grd_ref    ... source grid refinement, how often to refine grid in the search of a maximum.
#                    refinment ends up at: sinc/float((src_grd_ref)**2)
# min_relative_pow ... minimum in relative power [dB], for plotting
# enhance_vis      ... if true, CLEAN spectrum is convolved with a Gauss kernel for for better looks
# add_bg           ... adds background to the cleaned spectrum, can be useful if the spectrum is only parially cleaned. 
#                      Power measurements have to be taken with care though. Summation over (clean+bg spectrum) is not a viable option anymore to calculate the total power oa a component.
# inter_mode       ... Want interpolation of your plot? 'nearest' = none, or any other from here:
#                      http://matplotlib.org/examples/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods.html
# area             ... size of gauss kernel to be convelved with CLEAN-spectrum (size as in pixel, area x area)
# std_g            ... standard deviation of guassian kernel, controls the extent of the kernel
# show_clean_hist  ... switch to show slowness vector removal per iteration per component. 
#                  ... useful to check if your results are stabil.
# pwrZ             ... power on the Z component from autocorrelations
