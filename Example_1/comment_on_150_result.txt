As you can see, the iteration count of 150
is too large for the radial and transverse 
component and there are peaks with higher
velocities there are basically removed 
noise. The vertical component is still 
fine with the iteration count. The correct
approach would be to use different iteration
numbers for each component. I leave that 
to you to split up the script if that needs
to be done, or email me if need be.
